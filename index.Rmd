# Overview

In a previous DAnC workshop, you learned about basic for loops in R to iterate across multiple elements and apply some operation to each. Writing for loops from scratch is a critical skill for any data scientist. But there are also some helpful alternatives! 
In this session, I'll:

1. Introduce myself and briefly describe my background in environmental data science (20 min)

2. Demo several other useful options for iteration with tidyverse functions `dplyr::across()` and `dplyr::rowwise()` 

# Set-up

- Create a new R script or R Markdown document
- Attach the `tidyverse` and `palmerpenguins` packages

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
```

# From scratch for loop refresher

## A reminder loop

When we write a for loop, we ask R to iterate over elements in a series and apply some operation to them. For example, if we had a vector containing "pika", "fox", and "octopus" we could automate a statemnt "My favorite animal is the..." followed by each species by writing something like this:  

```{r}
# Create a vector of animals:
animals <- c("pika", "fox", "octopus") 

# Write a loop that iterates over all animals, adding "My favorite animal" before:
for (i in seq_along(animals)) {
  statement <- paste("My favorite animal is the", animals[i])
  print(statement)
}

```

As a reminder, `seq_along()` is a nice little function that creates a sequence starting at 1, continuing to the length of the vector. For example, `seq_along(animals)` here creates the sequence 1, 2, 3. 

## Some other (maybe more realistic) scenarios

There are all kinds of scenarios in data science where we may want to iterate over elements. For example: 

- Iterating over columns to find the mean for each
- Iterating over files in a directory to import each 
- Iterating over rows to find the mean of all columns by *row*
- Iterating over data frames to create a scatter plot of each
- And a whole bunch more!

# Other options for loops

## dplyr::across()

### Use `dplyr::across()` to iterate across columns

The `dplyr::across()` function "makes it easy to apply the same transformation to multiple columns," and plays nicely with a number of helper functions and options for customized iteration over the columns you're interested in. Generally, the `across()` function will be within `mutate()` or `summarize()`, and follows the basic structure: 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
across(.cols = (which columns?), .fns = (which functions?))
```

Let's take a look at the `penguins` data with `dplyr::glimpse`:

```{r}
glimpse(penguins)
```

### Example 1: Apply something across all columns

Convert all columns to class "character." 

```{r}
penguins_chr <- penguins %>% 
  mutate(across(.cols = everything(), as.character))

# Check out the classes: 
glimpse(penguins_chr)
```

### Example 2: Adding `where()` to specify columns

We can also specify which columns we want to apply the function to, using either a vector of column names (e.g. `c(species, island)`) *or* by using little helper functions within `where()`. For example, to only apply the square root (`sqrt`) function across numeric columns, I could use the following within `mutate()`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
across(.cols = where(is.numeric), .fns = sqrt)
```

**Note:** The `species`, `island` and `sex` columns in `penguins` are stored as factors. 

Let's convert all content in any factor variables to lowercase: 
```{r}
penguins %>% 
  mutate(across(.cols = where(is.factor), .fns = tolower))
```

More often, you won't see the arguments explicitly called, e.g.:
```{r}
penguins %>% 
  mutate(across(where(is.factor), tolower))
```

### Example 3: Within `summarize()` to find summary statistics by column

Find the mean and standard deviation of all columns that end with `mm`:
```{r}
penguins %>% 
  summarize(across(ends_with("mm"), mean, na.rm = TRUE))
```

### Example 4: Within `group_by() %>% summarize()`

## dplyr::rowwise()

### Use `dplyr::rowwise()` to iterate over rows

We used `across()` above to apply a function *across* multiple columns. What if we want to perform an operation on each *row*? 

You might think, "Oh, just use mutate and do the operation." But there are some issues with that - like if I have something like this: 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
df <- tribble(
  ~col_a, ~col_b,
  1, 1,
  10, 20
)

df %>% 
  kable() %>% 
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)
```

What happens if we use `mutate()` to find the mean of each *row*? 

```{r}
df %>% 
  mutate(mean_val = mean(c(col_a, col_b)))

df %>% 
  mutate(sum_val = sum(col_a, col_b))

df %>% 
  mutate(sum_val = col_a + col_b)
```

Hmm...that is not what we would expect. This finds the mean of *all* values in the data frame and returns that in the new column. 

#### ASIDE: Vectorized functions!

So how do we specify that we want to loop across each row? Use `rowwise()`!

```{r}
df %>% 
  rowwise() %>% 
  mutate(mean_val = mean(c(col_a, col_b)))
```

# Alternatives

## `apply()` family of functions 

See: `?apply()`

The `apply()` function "Returns a vector or array or list of values obtained by applying a function to margins of an array or matrix," where *margins* here can be either columns or rows. We'll use just one of the `apply()` functions, `lapply()` (there are others - `sapply()`, `vapply()`, etc.).

The general structure of `lapply()`: 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
lapply(vector / list, FUN = function)
```

#### Example: 

```{r}
mtcars %>% 
  apply(X = ., MARGIN = 2, FUN = mean)
```

## `purrr::map()`

You can use `purrr::map()` to iterate over pretty much anything - just consider it might be a bigger tool than you need (e.g. if `across()` or `rowwise()` does what you need, you may not need to worry about `purrr`).

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  split(.$species) %>%
  map(~lm(body_mass_g ~ flipper_length_mm, data = .x)) %>% 
  map(summary) %>% 
  map("coefficients")
```
